                        Ptuj is a town in northeastern Slovenia that is the seat of the 
                        Municipality of Ptuj. Ptuj, the oldest recorded city in Slovenia, 
                        has been inhabited since the late Stone Age and developed from a 
                        Roman military fort. Ptuj was located at a strategically important 
                        crossing of the Drava River, along a prehistoric trade route between 
                        the Baltic Sea and the Adriatic. <br><br> 
                        Traditionally the area was part 
                        of the Styria region and became part of the Austria-Hungarian Empire. 
                        In the early 20th century the majority of the residents were 
                        ethnic Germans, but today the population is largely Slovene. 
                        Residents of Ptuj are known as Ptujčani in Slovene.

                            The main attraction in Ptuj is undoubtedly it's castle that towers over the small town and was a strategic vantage point dating back to 70AD.
                            Ptuj Regional Museum brings together a fantastic array of historical art collections and archaeological findings from various sites around Ptuj. 
                            The area is rich in prehistoric sites dating back to the Stone Age.
